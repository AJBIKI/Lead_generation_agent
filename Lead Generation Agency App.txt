Building Strategy

-focusing on mvp first
- one  feature at a time
-take small steps  but build like ready for scaling easily
-db part in this project is very crucial make it like further scalable easily
- not use those  tech stack which is very complicated but no use , like typescript in backend is useless and burden
-look this is going to be a big project you have to save the log of every tiny detail so that in error you are not hallucinate 
-from first i will give you my GitHub repo which you will use for backtrack to understand previous working code.
-check very carefully that  no infinite loop is there anyhow because ai costing is included here .
-try to use free api for ai in majority of the field but dont compromise where really chatgpt key needed.
-i will go through every ai agents and ml that will use in this project for better customization in the architecture level of the ai agents because i know ai workflows but for the mvp you can add those agents on your own for initial stage and to understand overall architecture more precisely
-initial techstacks:- js, react 19.2,next.js 16.1.1,typescript, tailwind css, mongo db, shadcn ui components, vector databases, langchain ,lang-graph , python 3 , ai api providers and other what you need you can add 
-dont not overdo, if backend can be implemented in js do it on js ; no ts needed.
-for every sector like, frontend,backend,ml, diff. ai agents should be maintain through branch in GitHub
- go through all the other files so that you can understand overall prospect.


-you can add your own strategies and instructions for better performance and preferable that you add your own strategies to this.
